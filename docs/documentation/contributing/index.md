# Introduction

The purpose of this SDK isn't to give you another piece of abandoned software; but rather help experiment and define better standards for community SDKs.

[You can read more about the standards we're aiming to achieve on GitHub](https://github.com/bih/spotify-ruby#introduction).

# Expectations

First and foremost, we'd like to set clear what is expected from us, you and everyone else:

- **üíñ Care and fight for opinions.** &mdash; It's not about the loudest person in the room. It's not even always about the majority. It's about doing what is right; _all genuine voices are welcome with open arms_.
- **üëã Help guide each other.** &mdash; Everything should consider empathy for each other, their time, and their programming experience. Contributing should be a fun, learning experience - and helping each other helps!
- **‚ùóÔ∏è Enforce our Code of Conduct.** I will make no compromise in our [Code of Conduct] and act fast when bad actors are present.

# Getting Started

There's a few tools that we use:
